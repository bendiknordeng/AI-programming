- Add padding (1-2 on each side)
- Add bridge pattern knowledge
- Extend input planes (binary over all inputs)
    - empty/p1/p2 0/1/2 (empty/red/black)
    - black bridge 3 (black bridge endpoints)
    - white bridge 4 (white bridge endpoints)
    - to play 5/6 (red/black to play)
    - to play bridge 7 (active if cell is a form bridge)
    - to play bridge 8 (active if cell is a save bridge)
- Restructure convolutional net (AlphaGo). No pooling layers to preserve information
    - Input, shape (size * size * input planes)
    - (5 x 5, n_filters) Convolution with bias, followed by ReLU
    - d − 1 repetition of (3 × 3, n_filters) Convolution with bias, followed by ReLU
    - (1 × 1, 1) Convolution with position bias
    - Softmax
- The Hex board is symmetric under 180 degree rotation. Therefore,
  for each training example, add a rotated symmetric
  position randomly selected to train with probability 0.5.

DONE

- L(θ; D) = − Sum: log p_θ(a|s)
            (s,a)∈D
    - Explore negative log likelihood loss and KL divergence (use batchmean)
- Expand tree-policy with c_pb × ρ(s, a) / sqrt(N(s, a) + 1)
    - ρ(s, a) is model prediction from NN
- A leaf node is expanded only when its visit count exceeds an
  expansion threshold, which is set to 10 in MoHex 2.0.
